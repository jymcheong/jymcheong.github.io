TTPs are used to describe the employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other (tactics), the non-prescriptive methods used to perform missions or tasks (techniques), and the standard, detailed steps that prescribe how to perform specific tasks (procedures).</p> <p>In cybersecurity, TTPs have been adapted to describe the behavior of threat actors and the structured framework for executing cyberattacks. Understanding TTPs is crucial for identifying, analyzing, and responding to security threats. Tactics refer to the strategic (WHAT) objectives of an attacker, techniques are the (HOW) methods used to achieve these objectives, and procedures are the specific (WHEN) steps taken to execute the techniques.</p>"},{"location":"Attack%20Life%20Cycle/","title":"Attack Life Cycle","text":"<p>Attackers RINSE &amp; repeat... </p>"},{"location":"Attack%20Life%20Cycle/#direct-vs-indirect-access-to-objectives","title":"Direct vs Indirect Access to Objectives","text":"<p> Directly from <code>1.Recon</code> to <code>4.Execute Objectives</code> -&gt; Poor web-server configuration leads to exposure of unprotected sensitive files that can be downloaded by anyone.
