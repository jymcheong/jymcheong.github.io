Just need one employee to give attackers that chance to gain control over a HR asset when the malware infects like a <code>Patient Zero</code> &amp; persists within that endpoint. Why go through all that trouble when attackers can buy access into corporate Virtual Private Network?</p> <p></p> <p>The flow chart covers both direct &amp; indirect access.
